# Route 2 rapid iteration log — 2026-08-27

This is the current execution record for fast model iteration. It supplements
the historical protocol documents; it does not overwrite old failures, gates,
or terminal artifacts.

## Required record for every run

- run ID and objective;
- code commit and parent checkpoint/training commit;
- data split and protected-outcome read count;
- model/config, seed, optimizer/update budget when training occurs;
- physical GPU, start/end, wall time, peak memory;
- terminal summary or failure path;
- primary metrics and matched comparison;
- conclusion and next action.

## Iteration 0 — SetFlow V4 validation-only recovery

- Objective: recover the missing performance evaluation for the already
  terminal `v4_full` and `v4_single_mode` pass 4/6/8/10 checkpoints.
- Training commit: `edad89392077a0cf56e84dfcf94335606dd2b05a`.
- Parameter updates: 0; both training runs and all eight checkpoints are reused.
- Data: frozen Development Validation only; Development TEST reads 0; new final
  Evaluation reads 0.
- Metrics: common Validation NLL, recovery, top-k recovery, unique rate,
  legality, replay/numerical failures, and full-vs-single margins.
- Historical artifact policy: retain the original eight HEAD-mismatch failures
  and original technical `XEDITSETFLOW_V4_SCREEN_NO_GO`; write all recovery
  outputs to a new directory.
- Local verification: 30 focused tests passed; one pre-existing small-graph test
  could not execute under local Python 3.9 because the repository requires
  Python >=3.10. Syntax and diff checks passed. A100 Python 3.10 verification is
  pending.
- Status: implementation complete; remote exact-HEAD verification and launch
  pending.
- Conclusion: no model-performance conclusion until the eight Validation jobs
  reach terminal.
